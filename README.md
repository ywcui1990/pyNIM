This repository implements the Nonlinear Input Model in python. 

The Nonlinear Input Model (NIM) is a probabilistic model for describing nonlinear computation in sensory neurons. In this model, the predicted firing rate is given as a sum over nonlinear inputs followed by a 'spiking nonlinearity' function (equivalent to an LNLN cascade). 

The same toolbox implemented in Matlab can be found in [here](http://neurotheory.umd.edu/nimcode)

Our paper, which describes parameter estimation procedures in detail and shows a variety of applications, can be downloaded here:
